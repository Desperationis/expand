When making a git commit, always:
1. Read the diff to figure out what the commit is about. 
2. Do not include "CLAUDE" as the coauthor, or any mention of it, anywhere in the commit title, author, or description.
3. Split up the commit into several commits if and only if you feel it is too big / adds to many features. Use this only when necessary.
