description: When the user asks to make a checklist of a large feature, this writes a checklist to CHECKLIST.md.
---

Please plan out a step-by-step process on how you intend to go about implementing the feature(s) the user is asking for. Be extremely detailed. 

Write all of the steps in CHECKLIST.md as a checklist working in sections to eventually support this feature; Append it to the existing checklist if this file already exists.

If they don't exist already, write instructions in the CLAUDE.md to cross out these tasks in CHECKLIST.md as you implement them, only crossing them off once all of the unit and integration tests pass (regression test).

Make sure to add and update any unit and integration tests along the way. This is super important; Without a unit test for each step, you cannot be sure if it works.
