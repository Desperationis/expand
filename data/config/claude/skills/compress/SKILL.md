When "compressing" the CLAUDE.md checklist:
1. Make sure there is a CLAUDE.md file and that there is a completed checklist. If either the CLAUDE.md file doesn't exist, or there isn't a checklist, or the checklist isn't complete, stop and let the user know. 
2. Delete the entire checklist and anything related to it. 
3. If you think it would help the next reader in the future, include a short summary / description of the added features to CLAUDE.md. Just choose the best logical spots, the goal is to update, not append.
