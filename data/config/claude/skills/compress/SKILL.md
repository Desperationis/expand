description: Merges the details of a CHECKLIST.md file to CLAUDE.md
---

Only compress CHECKLIST.md if all entries are crossed out. If not, stop immediately. 


To "compress" CHECKLIST.md:
1. If CLAUDE.md doesn't exist, use /init .
2. Think about what CHECKLIST.md added to the project. If it changed something substantial to the project, modify the details in CLAUDE.md to support it. Do not write a summary of your changes. In cases where nothing project-changing or substantial was added, do not modify CLAUDE.md.
3. Delete CHECKLIST.md
